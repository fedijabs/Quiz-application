# Quiz-application

# Introduction
Welcome to the Console Quiz Application! This project is a simple, interactive quiz that runs in the console, challenging users to test their programming knowledge. Built in Python, JavaScript, and C#, it’s designed as a versatile tool for both learning and teaching, show essential programming techniques and providing hands-on coding examples. If you’re new to programming, or if you’re curious about how different languages handle similar tasks, this project offers a fun, practical way to learn.

# Overview
The Quiz Application is a simple console-based quiz application that allows users to test their knowledge in programming.
It is implemented in three languages, each version behaves similarly but is written in a different programming language,: Python, Java, and C#, providing cross-language examples of building a quiz program.
This program is perfect for teaching because it illustrates fundamental programming ideas including loops, conditional statements, input handling, and simple scoring.
This approach is great for anyone looking to:
  1) Understand language syntax and structure.
  2) Compare programming logic and problem-solving in different environments.
  3) Get familiar with the basics of building console applications.

# Project Goals
The primary goals of the Console Quiz Application are:
  - Help beginners get comfortable with basic programming concepts.
  - Provide a cross-language example of a console-based quiz application.
  - Illustrate essential programming concepts across Python, JavaScript, and C#.
  - Offer a simple and interactive learning experience for anyone interested in programming basics or comparing language features.
  - Deliver a fun, straightforward project for anyone curious about console applications.

# Features
Scoring System: Tracks and displays the score after each quiz session.
Simple User Interface: Console-based, easy to interact with.
Cross-Language Implementation: Examples in Python, Java, and C#.

# What is Inside
In each language-specific folder, you’ll find a quiz program that:
  - Asks a series of multiple-choice questions.
  - Tracks your score as you progress.
  - Gives you a final score summary when you finish.

# Technologies Used: 
Python: Python 3.x, using standard libraries.
Java: Java 8 or higher.
C#: .NET Core 3.1 or .NET 5.0+.

# Installation and Setup(Prerequisites)
Ensure you have the following installed:

  - Python 3.x: Python Download
  - Java (JDK 8 or higher): Java Download
  - .NET SDK (for C#): .NET SDK Download

# Configuration
Each language version may allow minor customization:
Questions and Answers: You can modify the questions in each version's source code.
Scoring Rules: Adjust the scoring logic within the code if needed.
